# Detailed Jira Software Features Document

Namaskar Gaurav! Aapke request ke anusar, maine Jira Software ke saare features ka ek complete detailed document taiyar kiya hai. Yeh document official Atlassian sources (jaise features page, documentation, aur 2026 updates) par based hai, jisme har feature ki in-depth explanation, sub-features, kaise kaam karta hai, aur implementation ideas shamil hain. Yeh aapke apne project ya website mein in features ko add karne ke liye reference ke roop mein use kiya ja sakta hai – jaise code structure, tech suggestions, aur best practices.

Document markdown format mein structured hai taaki aasani se read aur copy kar sakein. Har category se shuru karke, har feature ke liye sections hain:
- **Detailed Description**: Feature ki poori explanation.
- **How It Works**: Step-by-step functionality.
- **Sub-Features**: Related smaller elements.
- **Implementation Ideas**: Aapke project mein kaise banayein (tech stack suggestions jaise React, Node.js, etc.).

Yeh list aapke pichle message ki list par based hai, lekin maine Atlassian docs se depth add ki hai. Total features ~70 hain, isliye document lamba hai, lekin comprehensive. Agar koi specific feature modify karna hai ya code examples chahiye, bataiye.
